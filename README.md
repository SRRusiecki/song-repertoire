Estimating song repertoire size using capture-recapture approach in Python

Males of many birds sing elaborated songs consisting of various distinct sounds called syllables. Each individual has finite repertoire of different syllables it can sing. Total repertoire size is easy to measure in species with simple, repeatable songs but becomes more problematic in much more versatile singers.

The popular approach involves na√Øve counting of the number of different syllables in the available song recordings, however the value of the final repertoire size typically depends on length of recordings. Here I present simple and much more reliable alternative approach based on capture-recapture analysis of the repertoire. It allows estimating and comparing the repertoire size regardless of the length of the recordings used.  The notebook uses original research data on the song variation of the bluethroat, *Luscinia svecica*.
